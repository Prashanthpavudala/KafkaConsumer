# üéß KafkaConsumer

This project is a **Spring Boot** application that functions as a **Kafka Consumer**. Its primary role is to subscribe to the location update topic, consume the coordinate messages sent by the producer, and process them (in this case, simply logging them).

## üì¢ **Functionality**

The consumption logic is handled by a single method annotated with `@KafkaListener`.

* **Listener Method**: The `updateLocation` method in **`KafkaConfig`** is configured to listen for messages from the **`location-update-topic`** and belongs to the **`group-1`** group.
* **Processing**: When a message (a location string) is received, the application logs the consumed data: **`Consumed location is {location}`**.

* **Server Port**: **`8082`**
